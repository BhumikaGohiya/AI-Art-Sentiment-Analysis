## 🧭 Overview
This project investigates how audiences react to **AI-generated art** by analyzing YouTube comments through Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning.  
It applies **text cleaning, TF-IDF vectorization**, and a **Logistic Regression classifier** to predict whether a comment expresses **positive, negative, or neutral sentiment**.  

💡 The project highlights not just technical modeling, but also **ethical and emotional perspectives** in how people perceive AI-generated creativity.

## 🧠 Methodology

| Step | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **1️⃣ Data Cleaning** | Removed URLs, symbols, and punctuation. Converted all text to lowercase, tokenized comments, and removed English stopwords using **NLTK**. |
| **2️⃣ Sentiment Labeling** | Initially labeled comments using **TextBlob** polarity scores. Then trained a **Logistic Regression** classifier for refined sentiment prediction. |
| **3️⃣ Feature Engineering** | Transformed text into numerical features using **TF-IDF Vectorization** to capture important terms and weighting. |
| **4️⃣ Evaluation** | Measured performance with **Accuracy**, **F1-Score**, and **Classification Report**. Created visualizations using **matplotlib** and **seaborn**. |
